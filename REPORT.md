# Lab 3 Complete a Web API -- Project Report

## Description of Changes
I have completed the tests of the file ControllerTest.kt. There are 4 that cover the restful api for Employee.
For each test, I have mocked the EmployeeRepository and the CRUD operations of the repository.
Then I have verified that these operations are executed the exactly number of times the api calls each operation.
The code for mocks and verifications was provided in the laboratory guide.

## Technical Decisions
I have made no technical decisions because the code I need was provided in the laboratory guide.
My only decision was determining the placement of the code.

## Learning Outcomes
I understand the difference between an idempotent method and a safe method. In addition, I remembered how to use mocks.
A thing I did not know was that I can use customized bodies while testing, which I found quite interesting.
